### Candidate Search

Search for open Text Auditor issues:

````text
github-search_issues: query="repo:{owner}/{repo} is:issue is:open (label:text-auditor OR in:title \"[text-auditor]\") sort:updated-asc"
````

### Implementation

1. Read each file mentioned in the issue.
2. Apply the suggested text corrections. For each fix:
   - Verify the current text matches what the issue describes
   - Apply the suggested replacement
   - If the current text has changed since the issue was filed, skip that fix
3. Run any available linters or formatters to verify the changes don't break anything.
4. Commit the changes locally.

Only text changes — no logic, no refactoring, no new features.
