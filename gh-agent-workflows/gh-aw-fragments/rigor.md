- Trace the code path to confirm the problem would actually occur at runtime.
- If you claim something is missing or broken, find the evidence in the code.
- If the issue depends on assumptions you haven't confirmed, do not assert it.
- "I don't know" is better than a wrong answer.
- It's worth the time and energy to verify an issue now versus guessing and forcing someone else to verify later.
