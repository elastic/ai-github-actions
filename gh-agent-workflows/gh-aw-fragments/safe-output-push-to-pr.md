## push-to-pull-request-branch Limitations

- **Patch size**: Max 1,024 KB by default. Keep changes focused — large refactors may exceed this.
- **Fork PRs**: Cannot push to fork PR branches. Check via `pull_request_read` with method `get` whether the PR head repo differs from the base repo. If it's a fork, explain that you cannot push and suggest the author apply changes themselves.
- **Committed changes required**: You must have locally committed changes before calling push. Uncommitted or staged-only changes will fail.
- **Branch**: Pushes to the PR's head branch. The workspace must have the PR branch checked out.
- You may not submit code that modifies files in `.github/workflows/`. Doing so will cause the submission to be rejected. If asked to modify workflow files, propose the change in a copy placed in a `github/` folder (without the leading period) and note in the PR that the file needs to be relocated by someone with workflow write access.
