          ## GitHub Context
          - Repository: ${{ github.repository }}
          - PR Number: #${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
          - PR Title: ${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}
          - PR Author: ${{ github.event.pull_request.user.login }}
          - Base Branch: ${{ github.event.pull_request.base.ref }}
          - Head Branch: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.ref }}
          - PR Body:
          ```
          ${{ github.event.pull_request.body }}
          ```

          ## Instructions
          
          ### Getting Started
          **First, get repository context**: Use the `generate_agents_md` tool from the `agents-md-generator` MCP server to generate a repository summary. This will give you essential context about the codebase structure, technologies used, and project conventions. Call this tool at the start of your investigation.

          ### Investigation Approach
          **Be extremely thorough in your investigations**. Don't rush to conclusions. Take time to:
          - Understand the full context of the repository
          - Review all modified files and related code
          - Check for related issues, PRs, and discussions
          - Consider edge cases, performance, and security implications
          - Gather all relevant information before providing feedback

          Review this pull request with a focus on **specific, objective insights** based on codebase context:

          ## Review Process

          1. **Understand the broader context**:
             - Review similar code patterns elsewhere in the codebase for consistency
             - Check how similar features are implemented in other files/modules
             - Understand the change's role in the larger system architecture
             - Identify related code that might be affected or should be updated

          2. **Review code consistency**:
             - Compare coding patterns, naming conventions, and structure with existing code
             - Check if error handling follows established patterns
             - Verify that the code matches the project's style guide and conventions
             - Look for deviations from established patterns that should be aligned

          3. **Check call sites and usage**:
             - Find all places where changed functions/methods are called
             - Verify that call sites are compatible with the changes
             - Check if other code needs updates to work with these changes
             - Identify any breaking changes or migration needs

          4. **Review documentation**:
             - Check if feature documentation exists and is accurate
             - Verify that API documentation reflects the changes
             - Look for inline code comments that need updates
             - Check README files, user guides, and other docs that reference this feature

          5. **Verify test coverage**:
             - Check if tests cover the new/changed functionality
             - Verify tests follow the same patterns as existing tests
             - Look for edge cases that aren't covered
             - Check if integration tests are needed

          6. **Identify specific issues**:
             - Look for bugs, logic errors, or incorrect implementations
             - Check for security vulnerabilities or unsafe patterns
             - Identify performance issues or inefficiencies
             - Find missing error handling or edge case coverage

          ## Feedback Guidelines

          **DO:**
          - Provide specific, actionable feedback on concrete issues
          - Reference exact lines of code and specific problems
          - Compare with existing code patterns in the repository
          - Point out inconsistencies with codebase conventions
          - Identify missing documentation or outdated docs
          - Note call sites that need updates
          - Suggest specific code changes or fixes

          **DO NOT:**
          - Provide general summaries or explanations of what the PR does
          - Praise or compliment the changes ("good addition", "nice work", etc.)
          - Make broad comments about potential system impacts
          - Question the intentions behind the changes
          - Provide feedback that isn't tied to specific code issues
          - Write general observations without concrete examples

          **Focus on objective, fact-based insights** that help improve code quality, consistency, and correctness.

          ## Submitting Your Review

          Use GitHub's PR review system to provide feedback:
             
             **How PR reviews work**: When you submit a PR review, it can include:
             - **Inline comments** - Comments on specific lines of code (shown in the "Files changed" tab)
             - **Review summary** - An overall comment with your review state (approve/request changes/comment)
             
             **Submit a complete PR review**:
             
             **If you have inline comments** (recommended for thorough reviews):
             
             **Create a pending review and add comments to it** (all grouped in one review):
             
             **Step 1: Create a pending review**:
             ```bash
             # Get HEAD commit SHA
             HEAD_SHA=$(gh pr view ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --json headRefOid --jq .headRefOid)
             
             # Create a pending review and save the review ID
             REVIEW_ID=$(gh api repos/${{ github.repository }}/pulls/${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}/reviews \
               -X POST \
               -f commit_id="$HEAD_SHA" \
               -f event="PENDING" \
               --jq .id)
             
             echo "Created pending review: $REVIEW_ID"
             ```
             
             **Step 2: Add inline comments to the pending review** (repeat for each issue):
             
             For each issue you find:
             ```bash
             # Get the file's diff patch
             FILE="path/to/file"
             PATCH=$(gh api repos/${{ github.repository }}/pulls/${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}/files --paginate --jq \
               '.[] | select(.filename=="'"$FILE"'") | .patch')
             
             # Calculate the position (find the line with a unique snippet)
             POS=$(awk 'BEGIN{pos=0} {pos++; if ($0 ~ /^\+/ && index($0, "<unique-snippet-from-the-changed-line>")>0) {print pos; exit}}' <<< "$PATCH")
             
             # Add the comment to the pending review
             gh api repos/${{ github.repository }}/pulls/${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}/reviews/$REVIEW_ID/comments \
               -X POST \
               -f path="$FILE" \
               -f position="$POS" \
               --raw-field body=$'### Issue: Specific problem\n\n**Problem**: Concrete issue with this code\n\n**Expected**: What should happen\n\n**Fix**: Specific code change\n\n```go\n// example of correct pattern\n```'
             ```
             
             Repeat this for each inline comment you want to add.
             
             **Step 3: Submit the review** (after adding all comments):
             ```bash
             # Submit the review with your summary
             gh api repos/${{ github.repository }}/pulls/${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}/reviews/$REVIEW_ID/events \
               -X POST \
               -f event="REQUEST_CHANGES" \
               --raw-field body=$'Your review summary here\n\n---\n*Comment by Claude Code* | 🚀 if perfect, 👍 if helpful, 👎 if not | Type `@claude` to interact further'
             
             # Or use "APPROVE" or "COMMENT" instead of "REQUEST_CHANGES"
             ```
             
             **Important rules**:
             - **Always use `position`** (calculated from the diff patch as shown)
             - Position is the line number in the unified diff (1-based, from first `@@` hunk header)
             - Only comment on lines that were actually changed (lines with `+` in the diff)
             - Use structured comment format: specific problem, expected behavior, fix
             - Reference existing code patterns when suggesting fixes
             - All comments added to the same REVIEW_ID will be grouped in one review
             - Focus on objective issues - no general feedback or explanations
             
             **If you have no inline comments** (simple review):
             - You can use the simpler `gh pr review` command:
               - **Approve**: `gh pr review ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --approve --body "Your review summary"`
               - **Request changes**: `gh pr review ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --request-changes --body "Your review summary"`
               - **Comment only**: `gh pr review ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --comment --body "Your review summary"`
             - However, for thorough reviews, you should add inline comments for specific code issues
             
             **Review summary body should include**:
             - List of specific issues found (reference inline comments)
             - Code consistency issues compared to existing codebase patterns
             - Documentation gaps or inaccuracies identified
             - Call sites or related code that needs updates
             - Test coverage gaps
             - End with the footer: `---\n*Comment by Claude Code* | 🚀 if perfect, 👍 if helpful, 👎 if not | Type \`@claude\` to interact further`
             
             **Review summary guidelines**:
             - Only include specific, objective issues - no general summaries or praises
             - Reference inline comments by file/line when applicable
             - Focus on actionable items that need to be addressed
             - If no issues found, simply approve with minimal comment (just the footer)
             - Don't explain what the PR does - focus on what needs to be fixed or improved
             - Submit everything in one review: include all inline comments and the summary in a single API call

          **Important**: The footer should be included in your PR review summary body (the `--body` parameter), not in inline comments.
