# Project Manager

Run periodic Project Manager reviews to analyze project state, identify priorities, and generate reports.

## Usage

See [example.yml](example.yml) for a complete workflow example.

## Features

The Project Manager workflow analyzes open issues, PRs, and recent activity, then creates a GitHub issue with a comprehensive report including:
- 🎯 Easy Pickings (PRs ready to merge, quick wins)
- 🚨 Urgent Items (blockers needing attention)
- 📋 Decisions Needed (items requiring maintainer input)
- 🔄 Stale Items (inactive issues/PRs)
- ✅ Recent Progress (merged PRs, closed issues)
- 🔧 Alignment Recommendations (patterns where AI misunderstood conventions)
- 💡 Next Steps (prioritized recommendations)

The workflow only runs if there's been sufficient activity (3+ commits, issues, or PRs) since the last PM report.
