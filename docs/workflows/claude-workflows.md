# Claude Composite Actions

Traditional GitHub Actions wrapping Claude Code. Consumed via `uses:` in standard workflows.

> **Note:** This directory was renamed from `workflows/` to `claude-workflows/`. A symlink ensures backwards compatibility — existing `uses: elastic/ai-github-actions/claude-workflows/...@v0` references continue to work.

## Security

> **Important:** RWX and RWXP agents can run arbitrary commands, including git commit and git push. To prevent pushes, set `contents: read` (or `contents: none`) in your workflow's `permissions:`. Prompt constraints alone are not sufficient.

> Workflows triggered by user actions should restrict who can trigger Claude. The example workflows include an `author_association` check allowing only `OWNER`, `MEMBER`, and `COLLABORATOR`. See [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/elastic/ai-github-actions/blob/main/SECURITY.md) for detailed guidance.

    claude-oauth-token: ${{ secrets.CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN }}
    github-token: ${{ github.token }}
````

## Base action

The [base action](https://github.com/elastic/ai-github-actions/blob/main/claude-workflows/base/action.yml) provides full configurability:

| Input | Description | Required | Default |

## MCP servers

All workflow actions include default MCP servers (the base action does not):

- **agents-md-generator** — Generates repository summaries from AGENTS.md. Called automatically at startup.
- **public-code-search** — Search public GitHub repos for usage patterns and reference implementations.

Override with your own:

````yaml
- uses: elastic/ai-github-actions/claude-workflows/base@v0
  with:
    prompt: "Your prompt"
    claude-oauth-token: ${{ secrets.CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN }}
    mcp-servers: '{"mcpServers":{"my-server":{"type":"http","url":"https://my-server.example.com/mcp"}}}'
````
